            <h1>Challenges in Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR)</h1>
            <p>Although ALPR systems have shown great promise in traffic management, parking systems, and law enforcement, several challenges still remain. These challenges can affect the accuracy and efficiency of license plate detection and recognition.</p>

            <h2>1. Poor Lighting Conditions</h2>
            <p>ALPR systems often encounter difficulties in low-light or nighttime conditions. While infrared cameras can help, many systems still struggle with poor lighting environments like tunnels, nighttime traffic, or areas with heavy shadows. Lighting variability makes it harder for the system to capture clear images for detection and recognition.</p>

            <h2>2. Motion Blur</h2>
            <p>Fast-moving vehicles often cause motion blur in the images or video streams captured by cameras. When a vehicle moves too quickly, the ALPR system may fail to detect and recognize the license plate accurately. Motion blur reduces the clarity of the license plate, making Optical Character Recognition (OCR) more prone to errors.</p>

            <h2>3. Non-Standard License Plate Designs</h2>
            <p>License plates come in different designs, formats, colors, fonts, and sizes. Non-standard fonts or layouts can confuse OCR algorithms, reducing the accuracy of character recognition. Plates with special graphics, symbols, or country-specific features are particularly challenging for ALPR systems to handle uniformly.</p>

            <h2>4. Weather Conditions</h2>
            <p>Environmental factors such as rain, snow, fog, and dust can obscure license plates, making them difficult to detect. Bad weather can interfere with both image capture and recognition processes. Water droplets, snowflakes, or dirt on the camera lens can further degrade image quality.</p>

            <h2>5. Reflection and Glare</h2>
            <p>Reflections from shiny surfaces or strong light sources (such as sunlight or headlights) can create glare on license plates. This glare makes it difficult for ALPR systems to extract useful information, causing inaccurate or missed detections.</p>
